Kth Smallest Integer in BST

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) in the tree.
A binary search tree satisfies the following constraints:
- The left subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
