Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note: Intervals are non-overlapping even if they have a common point. For example, [1, 3] and [2, 4] are overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
