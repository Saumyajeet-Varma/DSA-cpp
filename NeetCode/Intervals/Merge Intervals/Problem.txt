Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
You may return the answer in any order.

Note: Intervals are non-overlapping if they have no common point. For example, [1, 2] and [3, 4] are non-overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are overlapping.
