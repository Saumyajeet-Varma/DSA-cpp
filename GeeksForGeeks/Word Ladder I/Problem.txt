Word Ladder I

Given two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list denoting wordList of unique words of equal lengths. Find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from startWord to targetWord.
Keep the following conditions in mind:
    - A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
    - Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
    - Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
    - startWord may or may not be part of the wordList

Note: If no possible way to transform sequence from startWord to targetWord return 0
