Bellman-Ford

Given an weighted graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented by a 2d array edges[][], where edges[i] = [u, v, w] represents a direct edge from node u to v having w edge weight. You are also given a source vertex src.
Your task is to compute the shortest distances from the source to all other vertices. If a vertex is unreachable from the source, its distance should be marked as 108. Additionally, if the graph contains a negative weight cycle, return [-1] to indicate that shortest paths cannot be reliably computed.
