Job Sequencing Problem

You are given three arrays: id, deadline, and profit, where each job is associated with an ID, a deadline, and a profit. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete, and only one job can be scheduled at a time. You will earn the profit associated with a job only if it is completed by its deadline.
Your task is to find:
01 - The maximum number of jobs that can be completed within their deadlines.
02 - The total maximum profit earned by completing those jobs.
