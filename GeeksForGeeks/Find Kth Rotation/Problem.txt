Find Kth Rotation

Given an increasing sorted rotated array arr of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.

Let's suppose we have an array arr = [2, 4, 6, 9], so if we rotate it by 2 times so that it will look like this:
    - After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
    - After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]
