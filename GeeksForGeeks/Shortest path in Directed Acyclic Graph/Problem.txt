Shortest path in Directed Acyclic Graph

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph of V vertices from 0 to n-1 and a 2D Integer array(or vector) edges[ ][ ] of length E, where there is a directed edge from edge[i][0] to edge[i][1] with a distance of edge[i][2] for all i.
Find the shortest path from src(0) vertex to all the vertices and if it is impossible to reach any vertex, then return -1 for that vertex.
