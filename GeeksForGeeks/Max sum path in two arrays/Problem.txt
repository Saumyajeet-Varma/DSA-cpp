Max sum path in two arrays

Given two sorted arrays of distinct integers arr1 and arr2. Each array may have some elements in common with the other array. Find the maximum sum of a path from the beginning of any array to the end of any array. You can switch from one array to another array only at the common elements.

Note:  When we switch from one array to other,  we need to consider the common element only once in the result.
