Geek's Training

Geek is going for a training program for n days. He can perform any of these activities: Running, Fighting, and Learning Practice. Each activity has some point on each day. As Geek wants to improve all his skills, he can't do the same activity on two consecutive days. Given a 2D array arr[][] of size n where arr[i][0], arr[i][1], and arr[i][2] represent the merit points for Running, Fighting, and Learning on the i-th day, determine the maximum total merit points Geek can achieve .
