Page Faults in LRU

In operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when the new page comes in. Whenever a new page is referred and is not present in memory, the page fault occurs and Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with a newly needed page.
Given a sequence of pages in an array pages[] of length N and memory capacity C, find the number of page faults using Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm.
