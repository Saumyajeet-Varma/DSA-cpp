Frequencies of Limited Range Array Elements

You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. These integers can be from 1 to p, and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers that lie in the range 1 to n.

Note:
    01. Do modify the array in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i) and assume 1-based indexing.
    02. The elements greater than n in the array can be ignored when counting.
