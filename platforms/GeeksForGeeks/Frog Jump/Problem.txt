Frog Jump

Given an integer array height[] where height[i] represents the height of the i-th stair, a frog starts from the first stair and wants to reach the top. From any stair i, the frog has two options: it can either jump to the (i+1)th stair or the (i+2)th stair. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stairs. Determine the minimum total cost required for the frog to reach the top.
