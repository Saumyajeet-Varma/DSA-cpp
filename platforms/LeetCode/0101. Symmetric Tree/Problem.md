# 101. Symmetric Tree

> Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return `true` if the tree is **symmetric** around its center (a mirror of itself), or `false` otherwise.

### Example:

![symmetrictree1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)

- Input: `root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]`  
- Output: `true`

![symmetrictree2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

- Input: `root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`  
- Output: `false`

### Constraints:
- `0 <= no. of Nodes <= 1000`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
