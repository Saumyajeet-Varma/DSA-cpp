# 61. Rotate List

> Medium

Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `k`, rotate the list to the **right** by `k` places and return *its head*.

### Example:

![rotatelist1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg)

- Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`  
- Output: `[4,5,1,2,3]`
- 
![rotatelist2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)

- Input: `head = [0,1,2], k = 4`  
- Output: `[2,0,1]`

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `0 <= sz <= 500`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 10⁹`
