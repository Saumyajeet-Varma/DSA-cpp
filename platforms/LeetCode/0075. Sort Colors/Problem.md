# 75. Sort Colors

> Medium

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored **red (0)**, **white (1)**, and **blue (2)**, sort the array **in-place** such that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order **red, white, and blue**.  
You must solve this **without using** the library’s sort function.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`  
- Output: `[0,0,1,1,2,2]`

- Input: `nums = [2,0,1]`  
- Output: `[0,1,2]`

- Input: `nums = [0]`  
- Output: `[0]`

### Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`
