# 62. Unique Paths

> Medium

There is a robot on an `m × n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** of the grid (at position `(1, 1)`).  
The robot can only move **down** or **right** at any point in time.  
Given the integers `m` and `n`, return *the number of possible unique paths* that the robot can take to reach the **bottom-right corner** (position `(m, n)`).

### Example:

- Input: `m = 3, n = 7`  
- Output: `28`

- Input: `m = 3, n = 2`  
- Output: `3`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
