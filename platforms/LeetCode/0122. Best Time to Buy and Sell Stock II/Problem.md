# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

> Easy

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the **price of a given stock on the ith day**.  
You may complete as **many transactions as you like** (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).  
**However**, you must sell the stock before you buy again.  
Return *the maximum profit* you can achieve.

### Example:
- Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
- Output: `7`

- Input: `prices = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
- Output: `4`

- Input: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
- Output: `0`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴`
