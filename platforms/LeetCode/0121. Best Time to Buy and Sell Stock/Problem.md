# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

> Easy

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the **price of a given stock on the ith day**.  
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to **buy** one stock and a different day in the future to **sell** that stock.  
Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*.  
If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Example:
- Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
- Output: `5`

- Input: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
- Output: `0`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10⁵`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴`
