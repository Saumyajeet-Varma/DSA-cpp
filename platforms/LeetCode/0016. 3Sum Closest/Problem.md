# 16. 3Sum Closest

> Medium

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the sum of the three integers in `nums` such that the **absolute difference** between the sum and `target` is **minimized**.  
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1`  
- Output: `2`  
- Explanation: The sum that is closest to target is `(-1 + 2 + 1) = 2`.

### Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10⁵ <= nums[i] <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁴ <= target <= 10⁴`
