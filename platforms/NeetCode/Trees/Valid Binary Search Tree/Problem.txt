Valid Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return true if it is a valid binary search tree, otherwise return false.
A valid binary search tree satisfies the following constraints:
- The left subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
