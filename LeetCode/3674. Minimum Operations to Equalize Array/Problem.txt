3674. Minimum Operations to Equalize Array

You are given an integer array nums of length n.
In one operation, choose any subarray nums[l...r] (0 <= l <= r < n) and replace each element in that subarray with the bitwise AND of all elements.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of nums equal.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
