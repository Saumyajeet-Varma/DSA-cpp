3676. Count Bowl Subarrays

You are given an integer array nums with distinct elements.
A subarray nums[l...r] of nums is called a bowl if:
    - The subarray has length at least 3. That is, r - l + 1 >= 3.
    - The minimum of its two ends is strictly greater than the maximum of all elements in between. That is, min(nums[l], nums[r]) > max(nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1]).
Return the number of bowl subarrays in nums.
